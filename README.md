# SPL1-Memory
This project simulates contact tracing system. The program simulates a social network (represented as a graph), in which an epidemic is spreading, and contact tracers are searching for infected people, trace their contacts, and attempt to break the chain of infection. The program using a JSON to get the social network graph, a list of agents (viruses and contact tracers) and additional settings. The class tree also has a pure virtual method traceTree() which is used by the contact tracer to decide which node to disconnect from the graph. There are three types of trees implemented in this program, these differ by their traceTree() method (RootTree, MaxRankTree, CycleTree).
The program free all pointers when terminates, use clone(), and all rule of five. The project support OOP, OOD , design patterns.
